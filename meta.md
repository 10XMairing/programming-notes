# Learning goals:- 
  How Python works
  - Find the lines of code which the interpreter generally go through everytime
  - Core packages and the API exposed by them
  - Memory management
  - Thread, bytecode, concurrency and execution
  - Understanding cpython source code
  - Navigate easily and quickly between C and Python code
  - Understand Python object model

  Build stuff with Python
  - Build useful things
  - Learn by building Computer Science ideas like:
    - Zero knowledge proofs
    - Proof of knowledge
    - Proof of Stake
    - Proof of work
    - blockchain
    - Interactive Proof systems
    - CAP theorum
    - Tower of Hanoi
    - Josepheus Problem
    - etc.
    

  Be careful about

  - Not wasting too much time on tricks and small cool stuff: goals is to understand deeply; not being cool
  - Going too broad : Limit yourself to understanding Python Core


  Learning how to learn:

  1. Interweaving - studying mixed topics
  2. Diffuse and Focussed thinking - Give intermitted breaks of free association
  3. Micro questions - Question what you are learning while you are learning through small questions
  4. Recalling - Try to make notes by remembering what you studied not by vocalizing or just immediately typing them down
  5. Spacing - Try to study same stuff over longer period of time than blocked continuous sprint
  6. Immediate vocalization or just typing code from a tutorial gives illusion of learning, not true learning

  - Why I am not learning fast?
     - Not serious enough about it
       - If you don't think it's worth it, leave it now!
     - No sense of urgency
       - Are you happy with what you will achieve with this pace? 
     - Being used to mediocrity and lack of focus
       - Are you the kind of person who reach mastery or who is happy with mediocre skills ?
     - Casual attitude
       - Can we kill casual attitude with a criticism feedback loop ? 
     - Perception of a habitual pace. Illusion that learning can only happen at this speed.
       - Are you the kind who live in illusions and perceptions? or the kind who break out of them?
