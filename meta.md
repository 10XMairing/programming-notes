Learning goals:- 
How Python works
- Find the lines of code which the interpreter generally go through everytime
- Core packages and the API exposed by them
- Memory management
- Thread, bytecode, concurrency and execution
- Understanding cpython source code
- Navigate easily and quickly between C and Python code
- Understand Python object model
- How to apply Python for
  - ~~Web Development preferably Flask~~
  - ~~Fast algorithms and datastructures~~
  - ~~Design patterns~~
  - ~~Best practices for code and deployment management~~
  - ~~Do some contribution back into other projects like Celery~~
  - write something ~~useful~~ which is fun
- Be careful about
  - Not wasting too much time on tricks and small cool stuff: goals is to understand deeply; not being cool
  - Going too broad : Limit yourself to understanding Python Core
~~Measuring the above goals:~~
~~- [ ] How Python works? Understanding CPython source code and how to meddle with it to get a desired behaviour should be a good milestone. ~~
~~Measure progress- [ ] How to apply Python? Write atleast one production ready project in WebDev and deploy it on cloud. Algo, DS and Patterns need to be implemented and practiced via questions~~
~~- [ ] Read Celery source code and find open issues. If not Celery find some other pure python project. Measure progress.~~
~~- [ ] Come up with a Pythonish library - something that makes dev life easier~~
- [ ] Read all PEP
- [ ] Read CPython source code
~~- [ ] Watch PyCon talks~~
- [ ] Have fun actually. ~~Don't focus too much on all this. ~~



Learning how to learn:

1. Interweaving - studying mixed topics
2. Diffuse and Focussed thinking - Give intermitted breaks of free association
3. Micro questions - Question what you are learning while you are learning through small questions
4. Recalling - Try to make notes by remembering what you studied not by vocalizing or just immediately typing them down
5. Spacing - Try to study same stuff over longer period of time than blocked continuous sprint
6. Immediate vocalization or just typing code from a tutorial gives illusion of learning, not true learning
