Learning goals:- 
How Python works
- Find the lines of code which the interpreter generally go through everytime
- Core packages and the API exposed by them
- Memory management
- Thread, bytecode, concurrency and execution
- Understanding cpython source code
- Navigate easily and quickly between C and Python code
- Understand Python object model
- How to apply Python for
  - Web Development preferably Flask
  - Fast algorithms and datastructures
  - Design patterns
  - Best practices for code and deployment management
  - Do some contribution back into other projects like Celery
  - write something useful
- Be careful about
  - Not wasting too much time on tricks and small cool stuff: goals is to understand deeply; not being cool
  - Going too broad : Limit yourself to understanding Python Core
Measuring the above goals:
- [ ] How Python works? Understanding CPython source code and how to meddle with it to get a desired behaviour should be a good milestone. 
Measure progress- [ ] How to apply Python? Write atleast one production ready project in WebDev and deploy it on cloud. Algo, DS and Patterns need to be implemented and practiced via questions
- [ ] Read Celery source code and find open issues. If not Celery find some other pure python project. Measure progress.
- [ ] Come up with a Pythonish library - something that makes dev life easier
- [ ] Read all PEP
- [ ] Read CPython source code
- [ ] Watch PyCon talks
