# Learning goals:- 
  How Python works
  - Find the lines of code which the interpreter generally go through everytime
  - Core packages and the API exposed by them
  - Memory management
  - Thread, bytecode, concurrency and execution
  - Understanding cpython source code
  - Navigate easily and quickly between C and Python code
  - Understand Python object model

  Build stuff with Python
  - Build useful things
  - first do it, then do it right, then do it better

  Be careful about

  - Not wasting too much time on tricks and small cool stuff: goals is to understand deeply; not being cool
  - Going too broad : Limit yourself to understanding Python Core


  Learning how to learn:

  1. Interweaving - studying mixed topics
  2. Diffuse and Focussed thinking - Give intermitted breaks of free association
  3. Micro questions - Question what you are learning while you are learning through small questions
  4. Recalling - Try to make notes by remembering what you studied not by vocalizing or just immediately typing them down
  5. Spacing - Try to study same stuff over longer period of time than blocked continuous sprint
  6. Immediate vocalization or just typing code from a tutorial gives illusion of learning, not true learning

  Why I am not learning fast?
    - Not serious enough about it
    - No sense of urgency 
    - Being used to mediocrity and lack of focus
    - Casual attitude
