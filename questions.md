# Questions in my mind

- Why interpreter can't import python3. What stops us to design the whole thing in a way that Interpreter is decoupled from the version of python.
- What benefit we get from not using flex/bison set of tools and doing some stuff manually?
- What files I can remove from Cpython and still get a subset of python which is having same expressive power ?
- Why can't I install libraries dynamically while a python program is running?
