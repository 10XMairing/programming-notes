# Questions in my mind

- Why interpreter can't import python3. What stops us to design the whole thing in a way that Interpreter is decoupled from the version of python.
- What benefit we get from not using flex/bison set of tools and doing some stuff manually?
- What files I can remove from Cpython and still get a subset of python which is having same expressive power ?
- Why can't I install libraries dynamically while a python program is running?
- Why can't programming languages we merged with each other, for example kind of a git merge and we can use each other them inside each other. Is it possible design languages like that?
- Can I do elementary cellular automata visualization as a network of nodes ? What kind of graphs it will create ? Can binary string be considered as a graph representation ? if so how ?
